This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

The algorithms are organized by year, starting from 2020.

The folders contain:
- A solution file with format `day_DD` for each day
- An `inputs` folder with an input file also per day
- `README.md` describing how to execute the algorithms

For the next year, I will include an extra level of programming languages since I plan to use more than one language to solve the problems.

I will also split the solution files in two, one containing the problem description and another for the solution.

In the `2020` folder, the solution files contain both: the problem description and the algorithm for the solution.
